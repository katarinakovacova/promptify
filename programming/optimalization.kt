/*
Problem Explanation:
This unoptimized version of the code checks all possible divisors for each number to determine if it is prime. This approach is inefficient because:
1. For each number `i`, it checks divisibility by all numbers from `2` up to `i - 1`, leading to many unnecessary checks.
2. The computational complexity is high, as each number performs multiple checks, making the algorithm slow for large inputs.

/*
Optimization Benefits:
- Faster Computation: By checking divisibility only up to the square root of `i`, we reduce the number of operations needed, resulting in faster performance, especially for larger numbers.
- Efficient Use of Previously Found Primes: The optimized code leverages previously found primes to reduce the need for additional divisibility checks, which lowers the complexity of the algorithm.

This optimization improves performance significantly in cases where a large range of prime numbers needs to be calculated.
