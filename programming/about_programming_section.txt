Programming section

I’ve completed the Programming section of Prompify. This section is designed to improve working with code and to support the people I mentor.
I’ve often encountered AI-generated code, which is not always an optimal solution.
Without understanding its purpose, code becomes just a collection of symbols with no deeper logic.

What has proven effective in my work with code and AI is focusing on:

- Designing project structures.
- Optimizing code for clarity and performance.
- Creating issues and documentation.
- Suggesting improvements.
- Brainstorming ideas for new personal projects.
