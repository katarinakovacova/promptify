Prompt script for creating a blog publication plan:

"Generate a detailed publication plan for a blog. The plan should:
1. Include a consistent posting schedule, suggesting dates or frequencies (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly).
2. Outline specific blog post ideas, each with a working title and a brief summary of the content.
3. Define target audience and SEO keywords to help optimize reach.
4. Include goals or metrics to track the success of each post (e.g., views, engagement, shares).

Organize the plan by month or week, and for each post idea, explain:
- Why it is relevant to the target audience.
- Key themes or topics to address.
- Any recommended promotional strategies to drive traffic (e.g., social media, email marketing)."
