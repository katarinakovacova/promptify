Lifestyle section

I find myself between generations Y and Z. I value my personal life and free time as much as my work.
My first experiments with simplifying life using AI began with a simple question: What meal can I prepare with the ingredients in my fridge?

This section of my project focuses on personal well-being, cooking, and organization.

It includes:
- Prompt scripts for creating healthy recipes for various meals throughout the day.
- Guides for structuring a productive daily schedule.
- Tips for skincare, wellness, and nutrition.
- Suggestions for improving work-life balance.
